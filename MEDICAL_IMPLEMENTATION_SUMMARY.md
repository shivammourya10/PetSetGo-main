- **Search functionality**: Users can search pets by name, species, or breed
- **Pet cards**: Each pet displays name, species, breed, and prescription count
- **Auto-selection**: Automatically selects the first pet when page loads

### 2. Medical Records Display
- **Records listing**: Shows all medical records for the selected pet
- **Date formatting**: Displays upload dates in a readable format
- **Image preview**: Shows prescription images with click-to-view functionality
- **Empty state**: Friendly message when no records exist

### 3. Prescription Upload

  - Accepts JPEG, PNG, and PDF files
  - Maximum file size of 5MB
  - Real-time validation feedback
- **Progress indication**: Shows loading state during upload
- **Success/error handling**: Clear feedback for upload results

### 4. Backend Integration
- **API Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /api/pets/{userId}/returnPets` - Fetch user's pets
  - `POST /api/medical/{petId}/medicalPresc` - Upload prescription
  - `GET /api/medical/{petId}/records` - Get medical records

```

### Key Components Used
- **Layout**: Consistent page structure
- **Card/CardBody**: Content containers
- **Button**: Interactive elements
- **Alert**: Success/error notifications
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations

### State Management
- **pets**: Array of user's pets
- **selectedPet**: Currently selected pet
- **medicalRecords**: Medical records for selected pet
- **loading/uploadLoading**: Loading states
- **error/success**: User feedback messages
- **showUploadModal**: Modal visibility
- **selectedFile**: File to upload

## User Experience
1. User navigates to `/medical` route

3. First pet is auto-selected and its medical records are displayed
4. User can search and select different pets
5. For each pet, user can view existing prescriptions or upload new ones
6. Upload process provides real-time feedback and validation

## Next Steps for User
1. Navigate to the medical records page via the application menu
2. Test the pet selection and search functionality
3. Try uploading a prescription file (JPEG, PNG, or PDF)
